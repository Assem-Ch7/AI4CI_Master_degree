Understanding the 65 kB TCP Congestion Window Limit in High-Speed Networks
Let's break it down step by step so it makes sense! You don't need advanced math, just follow the logic below.

What is the congestion window (CWND)?
TCP uses a “congestion window” (CWND) to decide how many bytes of data can be sent on the network before waiting for acknowledgments (ACKs).

It’s like a bucket: You can put up to CWND worth of data “in the pipe” before you must wait for the bucket to drain a little (not get ahead of the network).​

What happens with a 65 kB limit?
Old TCP standards set the maximum CWND to about 65,000 bytes (65 kB).

If you try to send a lot more, TCP won’t let you; it caps the "data in flight" to this value.

The Problem in a Modern, Fast, Long-Distance Network
Let’s use your case:

Bandwidth: 155.5 Mb/s (very fast)

Distance: 2000 km

Propagation speed: 200,000 km/s

First, what’s the delay?

It takes time for data to travel. Sending data from France to Turkey, for example, even at the speed of light, there’s a delay from the length of the path. This delay (RTT) is:

RTT
=
2
×
2000
200,000
=
0.02
 seconds
=
20
 ms
RTT= 
200,000
2×2000
 =0.02 seconds=20 ms
How much data can 'fit in the network' during that round trip?

This is called the bandwidth-delay product (BDP).

For this network: 155.5 Mb/s * 0.02 s = 3.11 Mbits = 388,750 bytes ≈ 380 kB

In plain words: At full speed, the network is "hungry" enough to handle 380 kB of data in flight.

But the window only allows 65 kB.

That means you can only use about 1/5 of the network’s capacity. Most of the time, the sender is waiting, unable to "fill the pipe."

Actual throughput you get:

Throughput
=
CWND
RTT
=
65,536
 bytes
×
8
0.02
 s
=
26.2
 Mbps
Throughput= 
RTT
CWND
 = 
0.02 s
65,536 bytes×8
 =26.2 Mbps
The link can do 155.5 Mbps, but you're getting only ~26 Mbps. The rest is wasted!

Why does this matter?
If you try to send large files or stream lots of data, the network will be mostly empty—you’re waiting, not sending. This is a serious performance bottleneck for high-speed, long-distance networks (like national backbones or connections between data centers).

How to solve this?
1. Use Window Scaling (RFC 1323):

Modern TCP adds a "scaling factor" to make the window way bigger (up to 1 GB or more), so the system can actually use the full network capacity.

Most modern systems support this, but it needs to be enabled on both ends.

2. Tune socket/buffer sizes:

Make sure the operating system and applications ask for large enough buffers.

3. If possible, lower RTT or upgrade network hardware:

Not realistic for long distances, but helps where possible!

Summary in One Sentence:
If your congestion window is too small for the network's speed and delay, most of the network goes unused. Window scaling and proper configuration fix this for modern high-speed networks.
