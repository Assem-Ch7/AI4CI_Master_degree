

Does the server know the identity of the client?

Yes. The server recognizes the client because it verified the public key in authorized_keys matches the private key you used.

How does the client know that the server is legitimate?

When you first connect, SSH checks the server's host key fingerprint. You can verify this fingerprint matches what the admin provides (or trust it after first connection).

What are the possible vulnerabilities?

Private key compromise (if someone steals your id_rsa)

Weak key (if not 4096-bit RSA)

Unprotected private key (no passphrase)

Man-in-the-middle attack (if you don't verify host key fingerprint first time)

Server misconfiguration (wrong permissions on authorized_keys)
